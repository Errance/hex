Like a fox crossing a frozen river almost to the other side, success is within reach but not guaranteed. One careless step can ruin everything. Patience, caution, and sustained effort are essential. This is both hopeful (success is near) and cautionary (don't celebrate too early). The cycle continues—endings are also beginnings.",
